            Many smaller consumer businesses rely on e-commerce completely to sell their products. 
            It is more cost-efficient to operate completely online, and advanced digital advertising technology allows 
            businesses to more effectively target potential customers. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of 
            operating an e-commerce business allows entrepreneurs to determine if it is right for them. Here some positive impact
            of e-commerce business:
            <br>
            <br>
            <li> Lower overhead costs: Since many small e-commerce enterprises may be run by a single entrepreneur, you probably won't need to hire someone until you've generated 
                enough revenue and sales.
                Additionally, you won't have to pay the large amount of money as compared to owing a physical shop and also
                You won’t need to lease property or face any of the numerous costs that come with operating a physical store.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>24/7 selling opportunities: E-commerce businesses are open as long as the internet doesn’t crash so,you don’t need to be available every time someone makes a purchase. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Customer data collection and customer targeting capabilities: You’ll have access to customer data. You should be able to track
                 customer buying habits and send out automated and customized emails encouraging future purchases. Targeting previous customers with
                 carefully selected marketing messages can increase sales.
