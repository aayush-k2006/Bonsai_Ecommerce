        <h2>(1) HTML</h2>

        <h3>
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and was created by Tim
Berners-Lee in 1990. HTML is a markup language that is used to produce
electronic texts (called pages) that are displayed on the Internet. Each page
contains a number of hyperlinks, which are links to other pages. Every web page
you view was created using a single HTML version. HTML coding guarantees that
text and images in your browser are formatted correctly. A browser would not be
able to display text as elements or load images or other elements without HTML.
HTML also supplies the page's basic structure, which is then covered with
Cascading Style Sheets to customize its appearance. HTML is like the bones
(structure) of a web page, and CSS is like the skin (appearance).

        <h3>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a simple and quick design method for
making web pages more appealing. CSS allows you to organize your web pages
by adding styles to them. The best part about employing this creative feature is
that it doesn't matter how HTML is used to construct web pages.

        </h3>
        <h2>(3) JavaScript</h2>
        <img src="img6.png"  height="300" />
        <h3>
            JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for a variety of
purposes, including web development, web apps, game creation, and more. It
enables you to add dynamic features to web sites that you couldn't do with just
HTML and CSS. It's an object-oriented, cross-platform language for developing
dynamic web pages. It is lightweight and interpreted, making it much faster than
other languages. It's also HTML-enabled, making it simple to utilize in online
applications. It may be anything on your screen that changes without requiring a
browser refresh. It might be anything from dynamic visuals to an automatically
generated Facebook timeline.

        <h2>(4) Visual Studio Code</h2>

        <img src="img1.jpeg"  height="300" />

        <h3>
            Microsoft created the source-code editor Visual Studio Code, sometimes known as VS Code, with the Electron Framework, and it is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Among the features are debugging assistance, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
Users have the option to customize their keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and theme as well as install extensions to add new features. 
I used this tools for writting my html , javascript and css code. The reason behind using this text editor was how effectively and beautifully
it display the coding without making it complex. This text editor also point out the errors and recommed the valid answer to that flaws.
