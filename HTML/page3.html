                Many smaller consumer businesses rely on e-commerce completely to sell their products. 
                It is more cost-efficient to operate completely online, and advanced digital advertising technology allows 
                businesses to more effectively target potential customers. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of 
                operating an e-commerce business allows entrepreneurs to determine if it is right for them. Here some negative  impact
                of e-commerce business:

Delivery: Many e-commerce companies provide next-day delivery, and Amazon provides same-day delivery to some consumers.
A one-person e-commerce store, on the other hand, typically cannot delivery things to clients as rapidly.
Try to have your things prepared for shipping in advance to improve your shipping speeds.

Technology and security: Phishing, malware, and ransomware can compromise or shut down your e-commerce business. 
You could be locked out of your systems or data if you don’t have sufficient protections in place. You’ll also need to ensure that 
attackers aren’t stealing credit card information or personal data from your customers. If your customers don’t trust your site, 
you won’t be able to sell them products in the future.
